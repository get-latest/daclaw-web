> Your AI assistant that actually works. First try.

SnappyClaw is a managed AI assistant platform that gives anyone — regardless of technical skill — a personalized AI buddy that works across Telegram, WhatsApp, and web chat. Powered by OpenClaw, deployed in seconds, zero configuration required.

## What SnappyClaw Does

- Provides a personal AI assistant with a real personality — not a blank chatbot
- Connects to Telegram, WhatsApp, and web chat in under 60 seconds
- Handles email, scheduling, reminders, writing, research, and more
- Remembers context and learns your preferences over time
- Runs on your own isolated, secure cloud instance
- Supports BYO LLM (Bring Your Own Language Model) or managed AI included

## Who It's For

- Small business owners who want AI automation without the complexity
- Non-technical professionals who want a personal AI assistant
- Creators, freelancers, and entrepreneurs who need productivity help
- Anyone who tried setting up an AI agent and gave up
